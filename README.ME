# Smart and Intelligent GSM based Automatic Meter Reading System
Automatic system to perform communication with energy smart meters for reading energy consumption or energy production

## Python Base Library
Used to perform communication with serial port

## Devices
- Modem ZTE MF626
- MODEM ZTE MF192
- Raspberry Pi with GSM SIM800L Add-on 

## AT Commands
- lsof /dev/ttyACM0

### To list the running process id.then use below command
- ps -ef | grep ttyACM0

### To list the number of running process id.then, use below commands
- ps -ef | grep ttyACM0 | wc -l

### Determine whether the tty is currently handling any processes by typing the following:
- ps -lt ttyACM0

### clear any process
This will clear any process that can be found running on the port and display the PID. If the tty is still unusable, continue to the next step.

- fuser -k /dev/ttyACM0

### flush outgoing data from the port

- ls -al /dev/ttyACM0
Your results should look similar to the following:

crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 dez 24 10:33 /dev/ttyACM0

This indicates that tty0 has a major device number of 166 and a minor device number of 0. Specify these numbers when using the strreset command as follows: 

- /usr/sbin/strreset -M 166 -m 0
